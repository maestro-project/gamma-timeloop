# GAMMA-TimeLoop #
This is the implementation of the mapper [GAMMA](https://dl.acm.org/doi/10.1145/3400302.3415639) using Timeloop as cost model.

GAMMA-Timeloop searches through the design space modeled by Timeloop and proposes an optimized mapping. It was introduced in this IISWC 2022 [paper](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2210.03731.pdf) and [talk](https://synergy.ece.gatech.edu/files/2022/11/IISWC2022Demysitifying_MSE_talk-final.pdf).

### Sister Repo: Gamma-Maestro ###
We also have GAMMA supporting MAESTRO as cost model. The sister repo can be found here [Gamma-Maestro](https://github.com/maestro-project/gamma). It searches through the design space of MAESTRO and proposes an optimized mapping.
